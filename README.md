WORK IN PROGRESS
...although most of the work is done by now, all that's left is an extra day of fun with CSS/styling and maybe some minor code improvements. It's a little project that turned very long and tedious. It uses PokeAPI and Next.js with Typescript. Don't mind the failed builds on this repo, it's caused by the fact that I've made this project on Windows and Visual Studio Code somehow doesn't work well there and it screws up my cache in a way I am not sure how to fix...
